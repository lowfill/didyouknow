It's not really complete yet, but it works fine and might as well share my progress.\r\n\r\nIt is a really simple plugin. It is a sidebar module that has little pieces of information for new users. The idea came from the File Tools plugin. But that was only for that plugin, and it would be better if it could be for any plugin. So far, this works with the Groups and Event Calendar plugins.\r\n\r\nThe site I work on is English/French so it is good for multiple languages.\r\n\r\nThanks to Matt Beckett for [helping me](http://community.elgg.org/discussion/view/1169408/extend-view-priority).\r\n\r\nTo customize the tips that show up, check out 'languages/en.php' for instructions.\r\n\r\nTo Do:\r\n* Add an admin panel to make it a lot easier to use and customize.\r\n* Add more plugins.\r\n* Figure out what else to do to make it better.","name":"Did You Know?","tagline":"the didyouknow elgg plugin","google":"UA-38051586-1"}
